This release also introduces asynchronous high-performance\\nActiveJ Redis client. Other components were optimized for the performance.\\n\\n* **Exceptions refactoring**\\n    * All public constant exceptions were removed/hidden.\\n    * **StacklessException** was removed. Classes that extended **StacklessException** now extend regular **Exception**,\\n      some of them are still *stackless*. *Stackless* exceptions provide the ability to include stack trace for debugging purposes.\\n      This can be achieved by setting exception\'s [ApplicationSetting](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/util-common/src/main/java/io/activej/common/ApplicationSettings.java)\\n      `withStackTrace` to **true**.\\n    * Renamed exceptions:\\n        * **ParseException** -> [MalformedDataException](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/util-common/src/main/java/io/activej/common/exception/MalformedDataException.java)\\n        * **HttpException** -> [HttpError](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/core-http/src/main/java/io/activej/http/HttpError.java)\\n          ([HttpException](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/core-http/src/main/java/io/activej/http/HttpException.java)\\n          is now a parent class for other HTTP exceptions)\\n        * **OTTransformException** -> [TransformException](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/extra/cloud-ot/src/main/java/io/activej/ot/exception/TransformException.java)\\n        * **OTNoCommitException** -> [NoCommitException](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/extra/cloud-ot/src/main/java/io/activej/ot/exception/NoCommitException.java)\\n    * Added new exceptions for top-level components, etc.\\n* Introduced asynchronous lightweight high-performance [ActiveJ Redis Client](https://github.com/activej/activej/tree/v4.0/extra/cloud-redis)\\n  with extendable API. [Examples](https://github.com/activej/activej/tree/v4.0/examples/cloud/redis) and [benchmarks](https://github.com/activej/activej/tree/v4.0/benchmarks/redis)\\n  for Redis client were added as well.\\n* Optimizations in network code, HTTP processing (especially in pipelining mode), and data serialization.\\n* Renamed **ByteBufQueue** -> [ByteBufs](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/core-bytebuf/src/main/java/io/activej/bytebuf/ByteBufs.java).\\n  Added byte index to **ByteScanner**, refactored `ByteBufs::scanBytes`.\\n  Added `ByteBufs::consumeBytes` method that works like `ByteBufs::scanBytes`, but actually consumes scanned bytes/bufs.\\n* Removed **StreamMapper**, now stream mapping can be achieved via `StreamFilter.mapper(Function<I, O>)`\\n* Removed **Transducer**, **StreamTransducer**, **AbstractStreamReducer**, **StreamMerger** classes. Merging of streams can be\\n  done via [StreamReducer](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/core-datastream/src/main/java/io/activej/datastream/processor/StreamReducer.java)\\n* Renamed **MergeSortReducer** -> **MergeReducer**, **MergeDistinctReducer** -> **DeduplicateReducer**\\n* Added ability to obtain irrelevant chunks from [Cube](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/extra/cloud-lsmt-cube/src/main/java/io/activej/cube/Cube.java)\\n  by calling `Cube::getIrrelevantChunks`. Irrelevant chunks can be cleaned up by calling `CubeConsolidationController::cleanupIrrelevantChunks`.\\n* Added JUnit test rule [ClassBuilderConstantsRule](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/test/src/main/java/io/activej/test/rules/ClassBuilderConstantsRule.java)\\n  which validates that all of the [ClassBuilder](https://github.com/activej/activej/blob/v4.0/core-codegen/src/main/java/io/activej/codegen/ClassBuilder.java)\'s\\n  static constants are cleared after test passes.\\n* Renamed most classes/methods that contained *parse* to contain *decode* instead."}]}')}}]);
